# streamsnipe
Watch sports or Twitch streams from the couch, via Raspberry Pi


### Approaches

Ideally I'd figure out how to embed these streams for better controller support and to avoid loading the chatrooms, etc.

Or transcode/stream over RTSP from a server to the pi?

Worst case, make a good controller-friendly link aggregator.
